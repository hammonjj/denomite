# Denomite
## General
This project is a test project as I build APIs in several different frameworks to determine what I most prefer these days. The landscape of backend frameworks has changed dramatically over the last few years since I last dug in to them. I have one other project I am going to build at the moment that will mirror this one called [Dartomite](https://github.com/hammonjj/dartomite)

This project is a fully-featured, self-contained admin panel built with Deno and Oak. It provides user management functionality with audit logging for changes made in the admin interface. Designed to be lightweight and flexible, this project can be used for both personal and commercial purposes with proper attribution.

Key features include:
- User management (create, update, delete users)
- Admin interface to manage users
- Audit logging for tracking changes
- Modular and scalable architecture
